Test methods

+ Initial Debug test

    Use a telnet client to connect to server. Type some requests in terminal and
    see if the response is expected and eyeball the server log.

+ Correctness test

    1) Host static_site with Apache server and Liso server. Send request to both
    server and see if the response matches.

    2) Use Chrome browser to view static_site, and analyze request/response with
    Fiddler(a tool similar to Wireshark).

+ Memory leak test
           
    Run server with valgrind. Initial multiple connections with siege.
    After a while kill siege and the server to see if there are **definitely lost**
    memory blocks.
                  
+ Evil test

    1) Initial multiple connections with ab/siege. Kill the process while
    it is still running. See if the server cleans up the closed sockets and
    buffers. Also use valgrind to make sure no memory leak in this case.

    2) Send crafted headers that are close to the size of buffer boardary with
    Fiddler and see if server handles them correctly when headers straddle buffer.

+ Stress test
                          
   Initial a huge amount of connections and trials with ab/siege. Let the
   server runs for a long time (~10min). See how the server behaves under high
   load and check if there are failed transaction in ab/siege reports.
